# Random Numbers Generator
## Made with ðŸ’™  by Ctrl Alt Tec, for HÃ©ctor. <img src = "good.png" height = 30px>
One of the most exciting things about HÃ©ctor's class is that participation is important.<br>
He randomly selects students and asks them questions, if they answer correctly their team gets competition points. <br>
We developed this system that generates random numbers to help HÃ©ctor with this task. <br>
The website allows to set the range and will randomly select a number. <br>
It is difficult (impossible) to develop a perfectly random method. But, we want to make sure that each student has the opportunity to participate. So numbers are stored and can't be drawn twice. (at least until the site is refreshed. ) <br>

## How it looks
